The mega checklist is built through iterative process

- take one small game chunk, in case of doubt chunk it smaller, e.g. weeping peninsula, castle morne, ..., each chunk should be simple
- for this game chunk, indentify what bosses to beat and other significant challenges
- for each boss, identify effetive builds
- of the listed effective builds, pick one based on what is available at this stage of the game
- list items needed for build and how to get them
- if there is any significant challenge / boss in getting the builds, consider evaluating what builds are effective again
- for the chosen builds, cross the requirements fulfilled from the list of requirements
