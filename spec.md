Okay, here is a refined specification document for the Elden Ring Megaplaythrough Checklist project, incorporating all your clarifications.

**Project Title:** Elden Ring Comprehensive Megaplaythrough Checklist

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** 2024-06-06

**1. Project Goal**

To define and execute a multi-NG+ "megaplaythrough" of Elden Ring (including DLC content) that ensures a comprehensive and flavorful experience. This involves systematically utilizing a wide array of game mechanics, builds, items, spells, and Ashes of War, tracked via a detailed checklist, while prioritizing builds thematically tailored to boss strengths and weaknesses.

**2. Core Principles**

*   **Flavor & Boss-Specific Builds:** The primary driver for build selection within each NG+ cycle segment should be thematic relevance and effectiveness against the challenges of specific areas or major bosses.
*   **Comprehensive Checklist Completion:** Successfully "checking off" every item on the defined requirements list is the ultimate measure of playthrough completion.
*   **Multi-NG+ Structure:** The playthrough will span multiple NG+ cycles (estimated ~NG+5/6, flexible) to accommodate the breadth of requirements without forcing suboptimal choices within a single run.
*   **Resource Awareness:** Planning must acknowledge limitations on Larval Tears (~18 base + 9 DLC = 27 total) and upgrade materials (especially Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones/Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones), particularly affecting build diversity in early NG+0. Utilizing both Standard and Somber weapon upgrade paths concurrently is encouraged.
*   **Prioritization:** Flavor and build effectiveness generally take precedence. Checklist items should be integrated naturally where possible; if not, dedicated segments within or across NG+ cycles will be planned for mop-up.

**4. Scope Definitions**

*   **"Use" / "Utilize":** For mechanics, weapon types, specific weapons, spells, and Ashes of War, this means employing the item/action effectively in a meaningful gameplay context, typically during at least one boss battle or clearing a significant area/challenge where it contributes to success. For consumables and buffs, activation/application according to their function constitutes "use" for checklist purposes, though strategic application is encouraged per Principle 1.
*   **"Representative Sample" (Ashes of War):** A selection covering the listed functional categories, demonstrating breadth without requiring exhaustive completion.
*   **"Consumable Types":** Defined by the functional categories listed in 3.9, not individual item variants.

**5. Execution Outline**

*   **NG+0:** Focus on game completion, exploration, collecting key items (Larval Tears, upgrade materials, spells, AoW, cookbooks), and experiencing 2-3 foundational builds (e.g., Quality -> INT -> STR/FAI). Prioritize obtaining gear needed for later cycles. Limit respecs pre-Rennala.
*   **NG+1 onwards:** Systematically target remaining checklist items. Focus cycles on specific themes: e.g., Hybrid Stats & Status Effects (NG+1), Pure Stats & Niche Weapons (NG+2), Specific Statuses (Sleep/Madness) & Mop-Up (NG+3).
*   **DLC Integration (NG+4 onwards recommended):** Incorporate DLC content, focusing builds around new weapons, spells, and AoW, while checking off DLC-specific requirements and any remaining base game items.
*   **Final Mop-Up Cycles (NG+4/5/6 as needed):** Review the checklist and dedicate builds or short gameplay segments to checking off any final remaining items.

**Confidence Score: 98/100** (Minor ambiguities inherent in subjective "flavor" are acceptable and don't hinder planning). This spec provides a clear and actionable foundation for the megaplaythrough.
